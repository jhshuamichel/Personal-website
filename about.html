            Even though I am not the Tiger Woods of fishing I really enjoy fishing. Maybe it has to do with the 
            combination of escaping the noise of the city and buidings. 
            <br>
            There is something amazing about the 
            ocean breeze and the stinky smell of the pier that just makes fishing a relaxing hobby of mine.
            <br>
            Fresh water fishing is probably my favorite. If you find a freshwater spot with clear water, that is the cherry on top.
            Being able to see the bass swim and look at your bait and take it.

            The best thing to do is to chill and be with my dogs. I have a german shephard and pomeranian.
            <br>
            Obviously the smaller dog thinks he is the manager of the family/body guard/protector.  But at the
            end of the day he is only 15lbs of fluff.
            <br>
            Even though one weighs 15lbs and the other 60lbs, my wife and I have the equal amount of love
            for them. I would not trade them for the world.
